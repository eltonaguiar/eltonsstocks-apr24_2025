- Create monthly reports summarizing user feedback and proposed actions.

## 6. Code Review and Refactoring Process

### Code Review Guidelines
- All changes must be reviewed by at least one other developer.
- Use pull request templates to ensure consistent information.
- Automate code style checks using tools like ESLint for JavaScript and Black for Python.

### Refactoring Schedule
- Dedicate 20% of sprint time to technical debt and refactoring.
- Conduct quarterly code health reviews to identify areas for improvement.

## 7. Automated Security Scanning

### Code Scanning
- Implement GitHub Actions or GitLab CI for automated security scans on every pull request.
- Use tools like Bandit for Python and ESLint security rules for JavaScript.

### Dependency Vulnerability Checking
- Use Snyk or Dependabot to automatically check for vulnerable dependencies.
- Set up alerts for critical vulnerabilities and automate pull requests for updates.

## 8. Feature Request and Bug Report Tracking

- Use GitHub Issues or Jira for tracking feature requests and bug reports.
- Implement a labeling system for prioritization (e.g., urgent, high, medium, low).
- Set up a triage process to review new issues weekly.

## 9. Performance Optimization Process

### Performance Benchmarks
- Establish baseline performance metrics for key operations (e.g., stock data retrieval, backtesting).
- Use tools like Apache JMeter or Locust for load testing.

### Optimization Schedule
- Conduct monthly performance reviews.
- Identify top 3 performance bottlenecks each month and create improvement plans.

## 10. Scaling Plan

### Potential Bottlenecks
- Database read/write operations
- API rate limits for stock data providers
- Computation-intensive backtesting processes

### Scaling Strategies
- Horizontal scaling: Add more application servers behind a load balancer.
- Vertical scaling: Upgrade server resources (CPU, RAM) for computation-intensive operations.
- Caching: Implement Redis for caching frequently accessed data.
- Database optimization: Use read replicas for heavy read operations.

## 11. Continuous Improvement of Stock Picking Algorithm

Based on the insights provided, we should continuously monitor and improve our stock picking algorithm by incorporating the following:

### Fundamental Factors
- Value: P/E, P/B, EV/EBITDA
- Quality: ROE, ROA, earnings stability
- Growth: sales/earnings revisions, analyst upgrades

### Technical Indicators
- Momentum: 12-month returns, Rate of Change (ROC)
- Moving Averages: 50/200-day crossovers
- Oscillators: RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands
- Volume: spikes vs. average, VWAP breaks

### Risk/Volatility Measures
- Low-volatility: downside deviation screens
- Beta: correlation to market

### Alternative & Sentiment Data
- News: event/catalyst detection using NLP
- Social media: Reddit/Twitter buzz scores
- Insider activity: buys/sells

### Microcap-Specific Factors (for stocks under $5)
- Float size (e.g., < 20M shares)
- Short interest (e.g., > 30%)
- Liquidity and potential for short squeezes

### Machine Learning Integration
- Implement an ensemble ML meta-model that combines factor scores and sentiment features.
- Explore reinforcement learning techniques to dynamically adjust strategy weights based on performance.

### Monitoring and Improvement Process
1. Track the performance of each factor, indicator, and advanced technique individually.
2. Conduct monthly reviews of performance and adjust weightings and parameters accordingly.
3. Implement A/B testing for new factors, algorithmic improvements, or advanced technique configurations.
4. Maintain a version control system for all algorithms to easily roll back changes if needed.
5. Set up alerts for significant deviations in algorithm performance, including advanced techniques.
6. Regularly update and retrain Markov Models and NLP models with new data.
7. Continuously refine statistical arbitrage strategies based on market conditions and performance.

By continuously monitoring these aspects and incorporating new data sources and techniques, we can iteratively improve our stock picking algorithm, especially for identifying potential high-growth stocks under $5.

Remember to always adhere to legal and ethical standards when implementing these strategies, and ensure proper risk management and diversification in the stock selection process.
