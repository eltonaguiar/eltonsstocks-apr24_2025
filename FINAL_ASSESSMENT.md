   - Benefits: Reduced API usage, faster data retrieval, and improved system scalability.

2. **Optimize database queries (Moderate)**
   - Current state: The current implementation may not be optimized for large datasets.
   - Recommendation: Review and optimize database queries, especially for watchlists and backtesting results. Consider implementing indexing and query optimization techniques.
   - Benefits: Faster query execution and improved system performance as the dataset grows.

### Medium Priority

1. **Implement horizontal scaling for the backend (Difficult)**
   - Current state: The current architecture may not support easy horizontal scaling.
   - Recommendation: Refactor the backend to support containerization (e.g., using Docker) and implement a load balancing solution.
   - Benefits: Improved system scalability and ability to handle increased load.

## 4. User Experience

### High Priority

1. **Implement real-time updates in the frontend (Moderate)**
   - Current state: The dashboard requires manual refresh to get updated data.
   - Recommendation: Implement WebSocket connections for real-time updates of stock prices, sentiment analysis, and statistical arbitrage results.
   - Benefits: Improved user experience with live data updates.

2. **Enhance error handling and user feedback in the frontend (Moderate)**
   - Current state: Limited error handling and user feedback for API failures.
   - Recommendation: Implement comprehensive error handling in the frontend, providing clear and helpful error messages to users when API calls fail or unexpected errors occur.
   - Benefits: Improved user experience and easier troubleshooting for users.

### Medium Priority

1. **Implement data visualization components (Moderate)**
   - Current state: Limited data visualization in the current dashboard.
   - Recommendation: Integrate charting libraries (e.g., Chart.js or D3.js) to provide visual representations of stock performance, backtesting results, and statistical arbitrage opportunities.
   - Benefits: Enhanced data interpretation and user engagement.

## 5. Testing Coverage

### High Priority

1. **Implement integration tests (Difficult)**
   - Current state: Limited or no integration tests observed.
