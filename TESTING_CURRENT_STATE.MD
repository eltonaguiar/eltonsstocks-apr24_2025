# Testing Current State

## Overview
This document outlines the current state of testing for the StockSpikeReplicator project, specifically focusing on the `scan_stocks_under_one_dollar` method in the `DataFetcher` class.

## Test Suite
We have implemented a comprehensive test suite in `test_data_fetchers.py` for the `scan_stocks_under_one_dollar` method. The test suite covers the following aspects:

1. Successful API call
2. Error handling
3. Caching mechanism
4. Pagination handling
5. Filtering of stocks based on price and exchange
6. Error logging
7. Performance with large datasets

## Current Issues
As of the last test run, all tests are failing due to the following main issues:

1. Asynchronous Context Manager: The `session.get()` method is not properly mocked as an asynchronous context manager. This is causing errors in all tests with the message: "'coroutine' object does not support the asynchronous context manager protocol".

2. Return Values: The `scan_stocks_under_one_dollar()` method is not returning the expected results. All tests that check the length of the returned result are failing because the method is returning an empty list instead of the expected data.

3. Error Logging: The error logging test is failing because the actual error message doesn't match the expected one. This suggests that the error handling in the main method needs to be adjusted.

## Next Steps
To address these issues and improve the test suite, the following steps should be taken when testing efforts resume:

1. Refactor the mock setup for `session.get()` to properly handle the asynchronous context manager protocol.
2. Review and update the `scan_stocks_under_one_dollar()` method in the `DataFetcher` class to ensure it's correctly implemented and returns the expected results.
3. Adjust the error handling and logging in the main method to match the expected behavior in the tests.
4. Once the above issues are resolved, run the tests again and address any remaining failures.
5. Consider adding more granular tests to cover edge cases and specific scenarios within the `scan_stocks_under_one_dollar()` method.
6. Implement integration tests to ensure the `DataFetcher` class works correctly with other components of the system.

## Conclusion
While the current test suite is comprehensive in its coverage, the implementation issues in both the tests and the main code are preventing successful test runs. Resolving these issues should be a priority when testing efforts resume, as it will ensure the reliability and correctness of the `scan_stocks_under_one_dollar()` method and the `DataFetcher` class as a whole.
